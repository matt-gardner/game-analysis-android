# Android client for Game Analysis framework

This was an attempt to get an Android client working for my [game analysis
framework](https://github.com/matt-gardner/game-analysis).  I didn't get very far, and I wasn't
handling dependencies correctly at that point, so this just has a jar file with the game analysis
code.
